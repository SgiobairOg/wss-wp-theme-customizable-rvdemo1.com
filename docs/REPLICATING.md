# Replicating PSN Sites
## Setup
1. Follow the instructions from the [README.md](../README.md) file to get started.
2. Download and install [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/page/2/en/index.html).

## Copy the CSS
1. Find the PSN theme's CSS file and navigate to it in your browser.
2. Copy all of the CSS into your `style.css` file.

## Copy the images
1. Find the PSN site's images folder. If the site is `mysite.com`, the URL to the images folder will look similar to this: `http://cdn-8.psndealer.com/e2/dealersite/images/mysite/`
2. Using HTTrack, download all of the contents of the PSN site's images folder.
3. Save all of the images into your theme's `images` folder.
